# Product Strategy V1 — Issuer‑First Worlds

## Executive Frame

CultureWallet is an **issuer‑first cultural network**. Artists, labels, and brands create gravity by publishing Worlds; users join, collect, recognize, and eventually connect. TrustMesh provides the bounded‑trust substrate; TRST provides economic continuity. The wallet is not the product — **Worlds are**.

This strategy replaces consumer‑first social onboarding with **supply‑side ignition**: enable issuers to mint culture, then let fans orbit.

---

## Core Thesis

> Culture precedes network. Network precedes economy.

We do not attempt to manufacture social graphs. We **inherit gravity** from existing cultural leaders and let trust and payments emerge only after meaning exists.

---

## Primary Actors

### 1. Issuers (Immediate Priority)
- Artists
- Labels
- Cultural brands
- Event operators

They create Worlds via **Worlds Studio (desktop)**.

### 2. Participants (Fans / Members)
- Join Worlds via WorldID
- Consume media
- Collect artifacts
- Send recognition signals
- Bond *later*, outside of Worlds

### 3. Network Layer (Deferred Unlock)
- Contacts
- Direct messaging
- Trust staking
- Peer payments

Unlocked only after participation thresholds.

---

## Product Pillars

### Pillar A — Worlds (Now)

A **World** is a sovereign cultural domain defined by:
- Issuer identity
- Media artifacts (audio, video, imagery)
- Membership passes
- Recognition signals
- Rules of engagement

Worlds are:
- Finite
- Branded
- Portable
- Non‑algorithmic

---

### Pillar B — Worlds Studio (Immediate)

A desktop‑first creation environment that allows issuers to:
- Create a World
- Inscribe media via HCS + Kiloscribe
- Define passes, tiers, and drops
- Issue recognition primitives
- Monitor engagement

This is the **Shopify of culture**, not a social dashboard.

---

### Pillar C — Participant Experience (Launch‑Safe)

Participants:
- Enter via WorldID (no wallet ceremony)
- View immersive World feed
- Collect artifacts
- Receive badges / access
- Share outward to Web2 (IG, TikTok, X)

No UGC feed. No cold social graph.

---

### Pillar D — TrustMesh Unlocks (Later)

Once thresholds are met:
- Contact bonding
- Recognition staking
- Messaging
- TRST transfers

Trust emerges **after meaning**, not before.

---

## Identity & Architecture Clarification

- **User Identity**: global, persistent, outside Worlds
- **WorldID**: contextual, issuer‑scoped
- **Contacts & Bonding**: live at the user layer, not the World layer

Worlds do not own people. People traverse Worlds.

---

## What We Are Explicitly NOT Doing (V1)

- No open social feed
- No algorithmic discovery
- No raw UGC posting
- No influencer gamification
- No speculative NFT marketplace

Restraint is a feature.

---

## Go‑To‑Market Focus

### Phase 1 — Issuer Gravity
- Onboard 5–10 artists / labels
- Each launches a World
- Each World has a drop

### Phase 2 — Cultural Proof
- Fans collect
- Signals flow
- Recognition accumulates

### Phase 3 — Network Unlock
- TrustMesh features activate
- Payments and bonding emerge naturally

---

## Strategic Advantage

- Escapes social cold‑start
- Aligns with creator professionalization
- Avoids surveillance economics
- Bridges Web2 distribution with Web3 ownership

CultureWallet is not a platform.

It is **a place where culture becomes infrastructure**.
