# Worlds Studio — Desktop UI v0

> Status: Canonical UI intent (v0) Audience: Product, Design (AG), Engineering, Issuer Partners Principle: **Worlds create gravity. Tools stay invisible.**

---

## 1. Purpose

Worlds Studio is a **desktop-first cultural control room** for artists, labels, and brands.

It exists to:

- Create Worlds
- Inscribe culture (media, drops, signals)
- Define access and meaning
- Observe cultural momentum

It is **not** a wallet, CMS, or social dashboard.

---

## 2. Mental Model

Think:

- *Studio*, not admin panel
- *World-building*, not posting
- *Ceremony*, not clicks

Issuers are sovereign inside their Worlds.
