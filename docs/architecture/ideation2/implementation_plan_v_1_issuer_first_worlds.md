# Implementation Plan V1 — Issuer-First Worlds

## Purpose
Operationalize the **Issuer-First Worlds** strategy by shipping a desktop-first **Worlds Studio**, enabling artists, labels, and brands to create cultural Worlds that drive gravity, participation, and downstream TrustMesh adoption.

This plan assumes:
- **Worlds create gravity first**
- **Users join by WorldID**
- **Trust, contacts, and payments unlock later**

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation (Immediate)

### 0.1 Worlds Studio (Desktop)
**Status:** Core exists → extend

Enhance the existing Issuer Studio into **Worlds Studio**:
- Create World (WorldID)
- World profile: name, description, banner, issuer identity
- World visibility controls (public / invite / drop-only)
- Issuer wallet + TRST settlement config

**Key Principle:** One World = one cultural context

---

### 0.2 Media + Signal Inscription

Enable issuers to inscribe cultural assets via:
- **HCS + KiloScribe** for media anchoring
- Metadata schemas for:
  - Media drops (audio, video, images)
  - Membership passes
  - Recognition signals

Outputs:
- Immutable reference
- Replayable feed objects
- Portable across clients

---

## Phase 1 — Cultural Gravity (Launch)

### 1.1 World Feed (Read-Only)

User-facing launch surface:
- Immersive World feed
- Issuer-published content only
- No UGC, no comments
- Follow / Subscribe CTA

**Goal:** Consume culture, not manage identity

---

### 1.2 Entry Without Friction

User entry:
- Join World via WorldID
- Walletless / low-friction onboarding
- Passive identity until threshold

Thresholds:
- Follow 1 World
- Claim 1 artifact

---

## Phase 2 — Participation Unlocks

### 2.1 Claimable Artifacts

Within a World:
- Limited artifacts
- Membership passes
- Event credentials

These become:
- Identity seeds
- Recognition anchors

---

### 2.2 Soft Trust Signals

Introduce non-sovereign signals:
- Attendance
- Participation
- Recognition (issuer → participant)

No peer trust yet.

---

## Phase 3 — Network Emergence

### 3.1 Identity Binding (Optional)

Prompt users to:
- Bind identity (TrustMesh)
- Persist artifacts
- Unlock messaging

Framed as **access unlock**, not compliance.

---

### 3.2 Contacts Outside Worlds

Key architectural rule:
- **Contacts + profiles live outside WorldID**
- Worlds remain contextual

This allows:
- Cross-World reputation
- Portable identity

---

## Phase 4 — Economic Activation

### 4.1 TRST Flows

Enable:
- Issuer → participant rewards
- Drop-based payouts
- Event settlements

All contextual to Worlds.

---

### 4.2 Issuer Monetization

Revenue streams:
- Mint fees
- Premium Worlds tools
- TRST flow participation

---

## Non-Goals (Explicit)

- ❌ Generic social feed
- ❌ Early UGC
- ❌ Cold-start messaging
- ❌ Wallet-first UX

---

## Success Criteria

Launch success =
- 5–10 active Worlds
- 1k+ passive participants
- Repeat issuer drops
- Zero friction complaints

---

## Strategic Note (for Frank)

This is not a wallet.
This is not a social app.

This is a **cultural substrate** where meaning precedes money, and identity emerges from participation.
